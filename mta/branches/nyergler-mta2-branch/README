The scicom.mta_web project includes the code and static files for the
Science Commons MTA web application.  This package requires Python 2.5 or later.

This package imports the `CC metadata scraper
<http://code.creativecommons.org/svnroot/metadata_scraper>`_ and
serves it on ``/scrape``; this is integrated using `Paste Deploy's
<http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_ `composite application
<http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_ support.

Development & Deployment
========================

`zc.buildout <http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ is used to manage
dependencies and deployment.  After checking out the code, run
``bootstrap.py`` to download zc.buildout and its dependencies ::

  $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py

After running bootstrap, you can run buildout to install the project for
development in the local directory ::

  $ ./bin/buildout

This will retrieve the run-time dependencies of the project and place them
in the ``eggs`` directory.  It will also create a development egg for the
MTA-specific code.  A development egg is a special link file in the 
``develop-eggs`` directory which links the code in development to the local
Python environment.

You can then run the test server by running the ``mta-ctl`` wrapper
script which buildout generates ::

  $ ./bin/mta-ctl fg

The server runs on port 8082.

Known / Reporting Issues 
========================

``scicom.mta_web`` has a fair amount of technical debt at this point.
We're trying to pay that off as we go, with varying degress of
success.  

You can find a list of open issues (and report new ones) in the `CC
Issue Tracker <http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue?status=-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&@sort=-activity&@search_text=&@dispname=SciCom&@filter=status,project&@group=priority&project=19&@columns=id,activity,title,creator,assignedto,status&@pagesize=50&@startwith=0>`_.
