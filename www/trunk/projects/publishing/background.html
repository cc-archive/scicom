      <p class="tagline">Providing standard, responsible copyright   agreements ensuring the right of scholars to archive their work on the public   Internet.</p>
      <h2>Background: Policies for Open Access to Scholarly Literature</h2>
      <p>Scholarly communication primarily involves three kinds of information: (1)   data generated by research, (2) peer-reviewed journal articles explaining and   interpreting the data, and (3) metadata that describes or interprets articles or   their underlying data. At each of these levels, the Internet and associated   digital networks create a range of opportunities and challenges for changing the   nature of what information is gathered, stored and communicated as well as how   and when such information is communicated, identified and located.</p>
      <p>But the full powers of new technological approaches, such as text mining and   semantic indexing, are not resulting in powerful new public resources. Contracts   between publishers and universities can explicitly forbid such use of technology   on scholarly resources, and the opportunities implicit in the Internet fall by   the wayside. Efforts to create an &quot;open access&quot; movement have shown real   success. But unfortunately the majority of scholarly research is unavailable,   either for reading or for processing in software.</p>
      <p>Approaches to the continuing accessibility problem break into three classes   at present. First, some major providers of research monies <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">encourage funded   scientists</a> to archive publications on the Web. Second, important <a href="http://www.arl.org/osc/faculty/index.html">research faculties</a> advocate access to institutional knowledge, and the right of academic use within   the academy, as fundamental to the mission of the university. Last, extensive   research has been conducted into the technical barriers against providing access   to the literature, resulting in both <a href="http://www.eprints.org/documentation/handbook/">software and &quot;how-to&quot;   guides for archiving</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the policy of encouragement and &quot;requests to archive&quot; is running   into the wall of traditional journals and scientific reluctance - the vast   majority of scholarly papers are not flowing onto the public internet, even   those <a href="http://www.nihms.nih.gov/stats/2005-05.html">funded by taxpayer   monies</a>. As a result, one key funder of life sciences research   recently strengthened its policy: <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD002766.html">anyone receiving funds will   make a copy of any published research available through a central, standard   database</a>. And <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/doc_archive/05-02-2006_COE06461_xml.pdf">legislation   pending before the United States Senate</a> espouses similar policy, not   just for life sciences research but on any research receiving federal funds. </p>
      <p>This idea extends to the academy. Faculty bodies and university   administration <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~facsen/Agenda/Senate05-06/11-29-05/2-LibrariesResolution.htm">are   recognizing the growing importance of access</a> as explorations of   university roles in copryight transfer are moving through policy discussions,   and in many cases, <a href="http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/policysignup/">have resulted in   institutional policies for access</a>. </p>
      <p>But such policy regimes reveal a problem not addressed by funders, the   academy, or technology: does the scientist have the legal right to comply with   the policy? </p>
      <h2>The problem: making it easy to comply with the policy</h2>
      <p>The most authoritative resource on journal policy for self-archiving (<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php?all=yes">the   RoMEO/SHERPA project</a>) asserts that more than 90% of journals allow   some form of archiving. In theory then, most authors in most journals can indeed   legally self-archive. In practice, whatever the journals may state as a policy,   many scientists are deterred by the legal issues, which are not well understood   by authors. The Wellcome Trust has commissioned a special effort to <a href="http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A2=ind06&amp;L=american-scientist-open-access-forum&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;F=l&amp;P=21845">examine,   clarify and update the existing policy research</a>. </p>
      <p>Restrictions against archiving arise from the industry practice of requiring   copyright assignments from the authors of scholarly papers to the publishers. In   return for the publisher's absorbing the costs of publication and peer review,   the authors alienate their copyrights. These agreements do often allow authors   to make archive copies available on the Internet, but with inconsistent policies   and terms on timing of release, file formats, and location of archives. Some   journals obscure their archiving policies on back pages of websites or don't   publish a policy at all.</p>
      <p>Scholars are reluctant to challenge these practices out of a fear of   retribution or rejection by the journals, or by the centrality of publication to   the scientific career process, including grant review, tenure committees, peer   esteem. This means that any legal barrier to archiving, perceived or real, makes   elusive the goal of universal archiving.</p>
      <p>The legal friction has not gone unaddressed. <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.html">Several</a> <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/about/scholarly/solutions.html#amendment">Addenda </a>to copyright transfer agreements and <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/publicaccess_QandA.htm#q26">suggested contract   language</a> to make compliance rights explicit have come from funders,   librarians and universities. These proposals provide a mechanism and tools to   negotiate and modify an existing copyright transfer agreement. Other approaches   include replacing the copyright alienation systems with non-exclusive grants of   a &quot;license to publish&quot; wherein the author retains ownership of the copyright and   thus the rights to archive the article.</p>
      <p>Early anecdotes suggest some success in terms of publisher acceptance of   these new approaches, but none of the existing legal tools rises to the level of   a standard. This creates, in turn, the risk of exacerbating the level of   confusion, inconsistency, and arbitrariness of the present system.</p>
      <h2>What would a solution look like?</h2>
      <p>Authors need to have the clear and unambiguous freedom to engage in their   normal everyday scholarly activities without contending with complex technology,   continuous amendments to contracts, or the need for a lawyer.</p>
      <p>Although institution, funder, and policymaker may craft different legal text   to reserve archiving rights for different classes of journal policy, these   variations reveal clear patterns of use: the key variations are time to release   an archived document, the format of the archived document, and the location of   the archived document. These patterns can be identified and expressed in   standard contract language. With significant community participation, the   scientific community can build a new set of shared norms instead of wasting   valuable resources through repeated negotiations. </p>
      <p>The solution can also draw on lessons learned in culture and software. For   maximal impact, final customized agreements should exist not only in complex   legal terminology (&quot;lawyer-readable&quot; form), but also in a &quot;layperson-readable&quot;   summary to enhance understanding and choice.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the solution can also draw on new technologies. The final   customized agreements should exist in a machine-readable format, which confers   an advantage in ease of use: scholars can pose a set of questions such as &quot;In   what journal am I publishing?&quot; and automatically create a legal document   appropriate to their needs. A secondary benefit of machine readability is a   trackable set of outcomes that will facilitate further improvements of both   forms and policies.</p>
