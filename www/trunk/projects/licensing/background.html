      <p class="tagline">Complex licensing and contracts around the   physical materials of science have created a world in which it is difficult for   scientific investigators to define the terms under which their work is re-used.   Science Commons' Materials Transfer project brings together funders of   neurodegenerative research, technology management professionals, and seasoned   attorneys to address this problem. </p>
      <p>We are guided in our work by the <a href="workinggroup.html">Materials Transfer Working   Group</a>.</p>
      <h2>Background: Biological Materials Transfer</h2>
      <p>Biological materials are essential to the practice of modern life science.   Cell lines, probes, and DNA represent tools for testing and validating   hypotheses of biological function and human health. Each offers a perspective   into biology that cannot be replicated without access to the material. Yet   despite the importance of biological materials for scientific research and   despite impressive initial efforts to standardize the terms for transfer, the   manner of their transfer remains overly complex &ndash; with significant impacts on   the quantity and quality of research.</p>
      <p>Owners of these materials transfer them to other institutions for use in   biological research, drug development and evaluation, creation of diagnostics,   and more. The materials move about under contractual agreements known as   material transfer agreements (&quot;MTAs&quot;). MTAs formalize the relationship between   the provider and the recipient of the material and answer such questions as: who   has the right to commercially exploit the material, and materials derived from   it? Who receives publication credit for research generated from use of the   materials? Who bears liability for damages from transfer and use of the   material? Who owns any intellectual property rights associated with the   material, and materials derived from it? (<a href="http://www.fvdhgp.de/MTApla.pdf">see more background on MTAs</a>) </p>
      <p>Technology managers and scientists alike have undertaken significant efforts   to solve licensing problems. The <a href="http://ott.od.nih.gov/NewPages/UBMTA.pdf">Uniform Biological Materials   Transfer Agreement</a> (or UBMTA) is in wide use, having been <a href="http://www.autm.net/aboutTT/aboutTT_umbtaSigs.cfm">adopted by over 250   institutions</a> since 1995. And the Organization for Economic   Co-operation and Development has issued <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/26/0,2340,en_2649_34537_34317658_1_1_1_1,00.html">guidelines   for licensing such materials</a> that go well beyond existing efforts.   However, these efforts have not prevented the rise of a complex web of   variations made to the standard agreements; nor have they sufficiently addressed   the problem that thickets in life sciences research are created because of these   complex and inter-locking variant agreements.</p>
      <p>The UBMTA and other efforts have run into several difficulties. </p>
      <ul class="paragraphic">
        <li>Firstly, a single, standard contract does not cover enough types of   biological materials transfer &ndash; one size does not fit all, so institutions <a href="http://www.wipo.int/tk/en/databases/contracts/summaries/mtacanada.html">substitute   their own MTAs</a>. </li>
        <li>Secondly, the terms of the UBMTA are overly complex for the scientific   community. Many scientists are unaware of its existence and carry memories of   bruising negotiations over non-standard material transfer. This both steers   scientists away from transfers and places undue strain on technology licensing   offices, which frequently negotiate both the business terms and the science on   behalf of their faculty clients. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The gap between the technology manager community and the scientific community   here has real impact: research is catalyzed most when resources are easy to   find, share, and the scientist makes use of the largest possible set of   materials. Research is inhibited when that set of materials is unnecessarily   restricted by complex licensing.</p>
      <p>Negotiations for materials transfer can be so protracted and painful that in   many cases scientists find it easier to re-make the material, often at taxpayer   expense. Wendy Streitz and Alan Bennett, of the University of California Office   of Research Administration and Technology, <a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/133/1/10">capture the problem   eloquently from the scientist's perspective</a>: &quot;One of your colleagues   at BigAg, Inc. (or at BigAg University) says that she'd be happy to send you her   transposon insertion lines that saturate the right arm of chromosome 9; you'll   just need to have a material transfer agreement (MTA) signed by your   institution. Six months later, the terms of the agreement are still under   negotiation, you've missed the field season, your grant has expired and there is   now a better resource that's been developed at LittleAg University&mdash;and if you   start negotiating an MTA now...&quot;</p>
      <p>The UBMTA had limited impact in solving the problems posed by material   transfer agreements despite the large community of adopters. This was recognized   by a Working Group commissioned in 1998 by the National Institutes of Health   which noted that <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/researchtools/">&quot;efforts to standardize license   terms for research tools have had limited success despite the clear support for   the UBMTA, at least in terms of signatories.&quot;</a></p>
      <p>In further support, empirical research hints at the scope of the problem.   Eric Campbell's study on data withholding among academic geneticists in the   Journal of the American Medical Association asserts there <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/4/473">&quot;is a pressing   need to clarify and expedite the process of sharing biomaterials.&quot;</a> The pressing need carries over into transfer of materials <a href="http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/110/4/425">between for-profit and   non-profit researchers as well</a>. Consequently, the goal of the UBMTA &ndash;   low transaction costs and easily shared materials &ndash; remains elusive.</p>
      <h2>What would a solution look like?</h2>
      <p>The success of the UBMTA in gaining signatories demonstrates a demand for   standardization. However, the single standard agreement has yet to create an   environment of low transaction costs or easily negotiated transfer of materials   between institutions, even universities, much less for-profit entities.</p>
      <p>To the extent that the variations on the UBMTA actually form patterns, which   may be expressed differently by each technology transfer office, scientific   researcher and related attorneys, those variations could be identified and   expressed in standard language. Currently the discovery of common ground between   parties uses valuable negotiating resources. Thus, any solution would   necessarily need to overcome the collective action problem facing   standardization: all might benefit from committing to limit custom solutions to   standard problems. In order to overcome defection we must have significant   participation from the technology manager community to build a new set of   norms.</p>
      <p>A solution must be designed to create an environment of low transaction cost,   easily negotiated transfer of materials between institutions, including academic   institutions and for-profit entities; a solution that avoids the pitfalls   encountered by the single standard agreement approach. Thus, Science Commons   envisages a solution that involves using the existing UBMTA as a baseline   agreement, but with a standard set of options &ndash; creating in effect an entire   suite of legally binding, standard contractual terms that can be mixed and   matched to create a customized agreement, tailored to fit the large variety of   transfer situations.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the contractual term suite and final customized agreements   should exist not only in complex, &quot;lawyer-readable&quot; form, but also in   human-readable form and in a machine-readable form. This will promote the use of   the agreement among non-legally trained scientists and researchers and may also   promote knowledge-sharing along with the transfer of the materials once the   agreement has been entered into.</p>
      <ul class="paragraphic">
        <li>First, the human-readable form will enable scientists to participate in the   discussion of the materials to be transferred. Science Commons believes that any   standard agreement should travel with clear, layperson-readable summaries of the   rights and obligations in the agreements, giving the individual researcher a   voice in the discussion &ndash; &quot;I'd like the standard agreement that allows for free   sharing to the academic world, and a standard license to the commercial world.&quot;   This is crucial to bringing the scientist back into the discussion of the   materials to be transferred. </li>
        <li>Second, the machine-readable form of the agreement will address an   additional consideration in scientific research, namely, how scientists find   biological materials. The status quo is a traditional system in which a   scientist reads a paper, contacts the author's laboratory, asks for the   materials and triggers a negotiation (in some cases, there is no formal   agreement at all). Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent   decades, there is slow uptake of online material repositories and it is   difficult to link materials from within papers in any open, standard form. Nor   do those repositories utilize transparent licensing methods. The   machine-readable form will make strides in overcoming this deficiency in the   system by enabling a digital rights description that can be linked in from   papers and databases using standard web technologies. </li>
        <li>Third, it should not only be feasible but easy for researchers to simply   publish, on their laboratory websites, a list of the materials available along   with their licensing terms. Such an ability would create a decentralized index   of open-license materials and address the current practice that scientists   deposit materials in a central resource before those materials can be searched.   Creating an agreement with a machine-readable component by which search engines   such as Google and Yahoo can index biological materials as available under   standard terms would mark a significant improvement over today's practices.        </li>
      </ul>
