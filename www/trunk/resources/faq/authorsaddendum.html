      <h2><a name="whatis" id="whatis"></a>What is a Science Commons Author's Addendum?</h2>
      <p> An addendum is a document used to change the terms   of a form agreement. Each of the Science Commons Author's Addenda is a form you   can use to change the terms of a publisher's standard publication agreement to   ensure that you, the author, retain certain freedoms to use your article and to   post it online. </p>
      <h2><a name="addenda-for" id="addenda-for"></a>Are these Addenda   only for scientific authors?</h2>
      <p> Not at all. Any author of a scholarly   article can use one of these addenda to alter the terms of her publishing   agreement.</p>
      <h2><a name="what_rights_retained" id="what_rights_retained"></a>What rights   do I retain through any of these Addenda?</h2>
      <p> Science Commons gives you   some options for which rights you seek to retain. Each Addendum enables you to   retain the freedom to use your article in your professional activities, such as   teaching, conference presentations, lectures, and in other scholarly works.</p>
      <p>The Addenda differ with respect to what you can post on the   publicly-accessible Internet and the terms under which you post it.</p>
      <p><a href="../../projects/publishing/scaa-openaccess-creativecommons-1.0.pdf"><strong>OpenAccess-CreativeCommons</strong></a> gives you sufficient rights to post a copy of the published version of your   article (usually in pdf form) online immediately to a site that does not charge   for access to the article. Primarily, this would mean posting to sites such as a   university digital library or a disciplinary repository, such as the National   Library of Medicine's <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a> server, or,   of course, to your own web site. </p>
      <p>Under <a href="../../projects/publishing/scaa-openaccess-creativecommons-1.0.pdf">OpenAccess-CreativeCommons</a>,   you also retain sufficient rights to grant to the reading public a Creative   Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Attribution Non Commercial   license</a>. A <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license specifies   uses that the author permits the reader to make with the article. Under this   option, you can grant to the public the right to re-use or re-post your article   so long as you are given credit as the author and so long as the reader's use is   non-commercial. (For those familiar with the <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.html">SPARC Author's   Addendum</a>, this option provides for retention of the same rights.) </p>
      <p><a href="../../projects/publishing/scaa-openaccess-publish-1.0.pdf"><strong>OpenAccess-Publish</strong></a> gives you   sufficient rights to post a copy of the published version of your article   (usually in pdf form) online immediately to a site that does not charge for   access to the article. (This is essentially the same provision as is in the <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/about/scholarly/copyright-form.html">MIT   Copyright Amendment</a>.) </p>
      <p><a href="../../projects/publishing/scaa-openaccess-delay-1.0.pdf"><strong>OpenAccess-Delay</strong></a> treats the   final version of your manuscript and the published version of your article   differently. Under this option, you have the right immediately to post your   final version of the article, as edited after peer review, to a site that does   not charge for access to the article. With respect to the published version of   your article, you can post it to a site that does not charge for access, but you   must arrange not to make the article available to the public until six months   after the date of publication. </p>
      <h2><a name="federal_funded" id="federal_funded"></a>What if I am a   federally-funded researcher. Can I use a Science Commons   Addendum?</h2>
      <p name="federal_funded"> Yes. In fact, if you are a university-based researcher, the   Addenda make clear that you can comply with your grant agreement or cooperative   agreement.</p>
      <h2><a name="clarify" id="clarify"></a>What does that   mean?</h2>
      <p name="clarify"> In grants and cooperative agreements with universities, the   federal government receives a copyright license to publish, reproduce, or   otherwise use copyrighted works, such as journal articles, prepared with federal   funds. You give this license to the government automatically upon completion of   your article.&nbsp; However, many journal publishers' copyright transfer agreements   demand that you transfer all rights under copyright in the article, without   acknowledging the fact that you have already given a license to the federal   government. This Addendum requires the publisher to acknowledge the existence of   any license already granted by you to your employer or to a funding agency, such   as NIH.</p>
      <h2><a name="how_to_use" id="how_to_use"></a>How do I use the   Science Commons Addendum?</h2>
      <p name="how_to_use"> Just follow these easy steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select and print the Science Commons Author Addendum of your choice. </li>
        <li>On the printed version of the Addendum you have chosen, fill in the name of   your article, the journal name, the authors' names, and the publisher's name, as   indicated. </li>
        <li>Sign and date the Author's Addendum. </li>
        <li>Sign and date the publisher's agreement. Immediately below your signature on   the publisher's form, write: &quot;Subject to attached Addendum.&quot; This is very   important because you want to make clear that your signature is a sign that you   accept the publisher's agreement only if the publisher accepts your Addendum. </li>
        <li>Make a copy of all three documents (the publisher's form, your Addendum, and   your cover letter) for your records. </li>
        <li>Staple the three original documents together. </li>
        <li>Mail the three original documents to the publisher. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Science   Commons is developing a web-based interface to the Author Addenda that is   scheduled for release in the fall of 2006.</p>
      <h2><a name="publishers_acceptance" id="publishers_acceptance"></a>A publisher   won't accept the terms of an Addendum, will it?</h2>
      <p> It depends. Anecdotal   evidence from a variety of sources reveals that many scholarly authors have had   success over the years in altering the terms of a publication agreement.   Sometimes this has been done by marking up the publisher's agreement; other   times the change has been done through use of an addendum. However, we are not   aware of any statistical data concerning the success rate.</p>
      <h2><a name="publisher_withdraws" id="publisher_withdraws"></a>What if the   publisher withdraws acceptance of the article after I send in an   Addendum?</h2>
      <p> We are aware of no instance in which a publisher has refused   to publish an article where the author sought to retain some non-exclusive   rights to the article. </p>
      <h2><a name="publisher_refuses" id="publisher_refuses"></a>What if the   publisher refuses to accept the Addendum?</h2>
      <p> Please send an <a href="mailto:press@creativecommons.org">email</a> to   Science Commons with the name of the journal, the Addendum you attached, and the   reasons for rejection. We are collecting empirical evidence on the use of such   Addenda for our ongoing work in this area.</p>
      <p>If the publisher refuses to publish your article under the terms of the   Addendum, you have some choices to make. Under copyright law, you, the author,   have the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, display, perform, and make   derivative works from your article. The publisher needs a signed agreement from   you for the publisher to obtain any or all of these exclusive rights. If the   publisher does not sign the Addendum but publishes the article anyway, the   Addendum specifies that such publication is an acceptance of the terms of the   Addendum.</p>
      <p>If the publisher refuses to sign the Addendum and refuses to publish the   article unless you sign the publisher's agreement without the Addendum, you have   to make a decision about whether this is the right publisher for you.</p>
      <p>By sending the Addendum you have communicated to the publisher that you care   about managing your copyright and think that one of the Science Commons Author's   Addenda reflects a fair balance between your interests and the publisher's. If   the publisher disagrees, find out which terms of the Addendum the publisher   objects to most. Some publishers may be willing to agree to some modifications   to their standard agreements.</p>
      <p>If the publisher's position is take-it-or-leave-it with respect to the   publisher's standard agreement, consider what alternative publications would be   willing to enter into a fair copyright agreement for your article. Speak with   your colleagues, your department chair, and/or your Dean about the choice you   face. Consider what the standing of your article would be if you accept an offer   from an <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Open Access   journal</a>. If you choose to publish elsewhere, make sure that you keep   copies of your correspondence with a journal that refused to accept the Addendum   for purposes of subsequent personnel evaluation.</p>
