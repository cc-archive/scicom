Material Transfer Agreements
----------------------------

This project includes the code and static files for serving the Science
Commons Material Transfer Agreements.  

The code requires Python 2.4 or later.

Development & Deployment
========================

This project uses zc.buildout to manage dependencies and deployment.  After
checking out the code, run ``bootstrap.py`` to download zc.buildout and its
dependencies ::

  $ python bootstrap.py

After running bootstrap, you can run buildout to install the project for
development in the local directory ::

  $ ./bin/buildout

This will retrieve the run-time dependencies of the project and place them
in the ``eggs`` directory.  It will also create a development egg for the
MTA-specific code.  A development egg is a special link file in the 
``develop-eggs`` directory which links the code in development to the local
Python environment.

You can then run the test server by running the ``mta`` wrapper script which
buildout generates ::

  $ ./bin/mta
