<h1>Materials Transfer Agreement</h1>

<p>Science Commons Materials Transfer Agreements (MTAs) are contracts that govern the transfer of tangible research materials from one research institution (the provider) to another (the recipient).  They are most commonly employed in the transfer of "unique research resources" such as cell lines, monoclonal antibodies, reagents, animal models, growth factors, combinatorial chemistry and DNA libraries, clones and cloning tools (such as PCR), methods, laboratory equipment and machines. Non-biological and synthetic materials, such as certain nano-materials, chemical reagents, and chemical substrates may be shared under MTAs as well.</p>
