      <h2><a name="canicc" id="canicc"></a>Can a Creative Commons license be applied to a   database?</h2>
      <p> In short, yes&mdash;a Creative Commons license can probably be   applied to a database, or at least, to some aspects of a database.</p>
      <p>Databases usually are comprised of at least four elements: (1) a set of   field names identifying the data; (2) a structure (or model), which includes the   organization of fields and relations among them; (3) data sheets; and (4) data.   All of the Creative Commons licenses can be applied to these elements to the   extent that copyright applies to them (and the Dutch and Belgium licenses can   also be applied to the data, for reasons <a href="#dbreplicate">discussed in   greater detail below</a>.&nbsp; Copyright applies to minimally creative works   expressed in a fixed form.&nbsp; In most databases, items (2) and (3) - the structure   and the data sheet - will reflect sufficient creativity for copyright to apply.&nbsp;   A Creative Commons license applied to these elements will permit copying of   these elements under the conditions of the license selected.&nbsp; Field names, such   as &quot;Address&quot; for the name of the field for street address information, are less   likely to be protected by copyright because they often do not reflect   creativity.</p>
      <p> In the United States, data will be protected by copyright   only if they express creativity.&nbsp; Some databases will satisfy this condition,   such as a database containing poetry or a wiki containing prose.&nbsp; Many   databases, however, contain factual information that may have taken a great deal   of effort to gather, such as the results of a series of complicated and creative   experiments.&nbsp; Nonetheless, that information is not protected by copyright and   cannot be licensed under the terms of a Creative Commons license.</p>
      <p>Note -   for databases subject to the laws of members of the European Union and certain   other countries, the law supplies a special right for databases.&nbsp; Except in the   Netherlands and Belgium Creative Commons Licenses, Creative Commons licenses do   not apply to this right (for more detail, <a href="#dbreplicate">see below</a>).   </p>
      <p>There are three things to keep in mind when considering whether to   apply a Creative Commons license to a database: (1) that the necessary rights or   permissions have been obtained to make a database and any copyrightable elements   available under a Creative Commons license; (2) that only those parts of the   database that the database provider wants to make available under a Creative   Commons license are so licensed; and (3) if not all aspects of the database are   protected by copyright, there should be a clear statement to this effect to   indicate to users which aspects are subject to the license and which are not.</p>
      <p>This FAQ explains each of these issues in a little more detail for   database providers (and users). Please read all of this FAQ before deciding   whether to apply a Creative Commons license to your database so that you   understand how to make your database available using a Creative Commons license   in a way that matches your preferences. Please also note that there may be other   legal rights and obligations that arise in relation to a database that are   beyond the scope of this FAQ.</p>
      <h2><a name="whatkind" id="whatkind"></a>What kinds of things can be licensed under a Creative   Commons license?</h2>
      <p>Creative Commons licenses only apply to materials   that are protected by copyright. This means that they can be applied to protect   things like articles, text, websites, blogs and other publications; music,   artwork video and other audio and visual materials; and also more &quot;utilitarian&quot;   items such as software, tables and compilations.</p>
      <p>As a general rule,   copyright is said to protect &quot;expressive, creative works&quot; that are fixed in a   tangible medium. The requirement that a work be expressive and/or creative to   attract copyright protection means that it has to be the product of someone's   effort and ingenuity. Mere facts and ideas are not protectable. This has   particular importance for databases because databases often contain compilations   of factual information.</p>
      <h2><a name="ccdb" id="ccdb"></a>So, a Creative Commons license can be applied to a   database?</h2>
      <p>Yes, a Creative Commons license can be applied to the   structure or model of a database provided that is protected by copyright. The   extent to which a database is protected by copyright law will vary depending on   the jurisdiction in which the database is located. In general, however, the   entire database as well as some elements of the database are likely to be   copyrighted; some elements may not be protected by copyright.</p>
      <p>Essentially, those parts of the database that consist of expressive,   creative effort will be protected by copyright. For example, subject to some   exceptions, the database model is likely to be protected by copyright. The   extent to which the database model is copyright-protected will depend on the   jurisdiction. In the US, for example, the &quot;white pages&quot; telephone directories   are not protected by copyright because they contain names and address in   unoriginal, alphabetical ordering. By contrast, a directory of Chinese   businesses is protected by copyright because of the effort, selection and   arrangement that went into creating the directory. In Australia, however, even   &quot;white pages&quot; telephone directories are protected because the courts there   consider the effort and &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; in compiling data, even if it is   ordered unoriginally, to be sufficient to warrant copyright protection.</p>
      <h2><a name="dbcopyright" id="dbcopyright"></a>Which database   components are likely to be protected by copyright?</h2>
      <p>In general,   there are likely to be four main components of a database:</p>
      <p>(i) The   database model: this is a specification describing how a database is structured   and organized.&nbsp; Parts of the database model, or schema, include database tables   and table indexes. In general, as discussed above, it is likely that the overall   structure and organization of the database is protected by copyright. There may   be exceptions to this depending on the jurisdiction in which the database is   located. In the United States, for example, unoriginal and obvious orderings of   factual information have been held to not be protected by copyright.</p>
      <p>(ii)   The data entry &amp; output sheet: these contain questions and the answers to   these questions are stored in a database.&nbsp; For example, a web page asking a   scientist to enter a gene's name, its pathway information, and its ontology   would constitute a data entry sheet. In general, the format and layout of these   sheets will be protected by copyright. This protection may not extend to the   information (the data) contained within these sheets, however, as discussed   below.</p>
      <p> (iii) Field names: field names described data sets, for example   &quot;Address&quot; for the name of the field for street address information. These are   less likely to be protected by copyright because they often do not reflect   creativity.</p>
      <p> (iv) The data: - whether the data itself is copyrightable,   depends on what it is. To the extent it consists of factual information, it will   not be copyrightable. For example, the contents of NCBI's Entrez Gene database   include gene names, descriptions, pathways, protein products, and other facts.   However, to the extent the data is creative and expressive works, such as papers   or photographs, then the database content itself is likely to be protected by   copyright. Even if copyright protection extends to a paper or photograph   contained in a database, that copyright will not extend to the information and   ideas expressed in these materials.</p>
      <p>Database providers need to think   carefully about which elements of the database they want people to be able to   use and reuse and ensure that they only make available these elements available   under the Creative Commons license.</p>
      <h2><a name="dbsoftware" id="dbsoftware"></a>What about the software that runs the   database?</h2>
      <p>In general, the software that runs the database will be   protected by copyright but that copyright will be owned and controlled by the   third party software provider who creates that software and licenses it to a   database provider to use. Thus, a database provider needs to be clear that it is   applying the Creative Commons license only to the database elements, not the   software.</p>
      <p> Creative Commons licenses are designed to apply to content such   as documentation, articles, music, videos and the like. For software, we   recommend that it is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-gpl?lang=en">CC-GNU-GPL   license</a>. Obviously, this license cannot be applied to software that   is obtained from a third party under their own license conditions.</p>
      <h2><a name="dbfactual" id="dbfactual"></a>How will people know that   they can use the factual information in a database?</h2>
      <p> We recommend   that database providers make it clear that only some elements of their database   are protected by copyright (and subject to a Creative Commons license) and some   elements are free to be used &amp; reused outside of the license.</p>
      <p>As you   know, Creative Commons and Science Commons work to promote freely available   content and information. Our preference is that people do not overstate their   copyright or other legal rights. Consequently, we adopt the position that &quot;facts   are free&quot; and people should be educated so that they are aware of this. Database   providers may want to think about including a statement where you include your   Creative Commons &quot;Some Rights Reserved&quot; button that acknowledges that the   database is only under a Creative Commons license &quot;to the extent that copyright   protects the database&quot; and then give some examples of the elements in the   database that are likely to be factual and excluded from the scope of copyright   and the Creative Commons license.</p>
      <h2><a name="dbreplicate" id="dbreplicate"></a>If I apply a Creative Commons license to my database,   does this mean people can replicate the database?</h2>
      <p> Yes, if a   Creative Commons licenses is applied to an entire database or most of a   database, then the Creative Commons licenses will give people the right to copy   and distribute the entire database and/or the database elements to the Creative   Commons license has been applied. However, if the database is hosted in Europe   (or a jurisdiction with a similar law), a different type of right&mdash;a sui generis   (i.e. copyright-like) database right&mdash;may give the database provider an   additional layer of protection against someone copying the entire database or   database elements that are under a Creative Commons license.</p>
      <p> To briefly   explain, the database right applies to databases that have been created with   considerable investment and protects against unauthorized extraction and   re-utilization of the data. In general, it is an infringement of this database   right to appropriate and distribute to the public the whole or part of the   contents of the database without the database owner's permission.</p>
      <p>With   two exceptions, a Creative Commons license will not impact the existence of this   database right. This means that, because the Creative Commons licenses apply   only to copyright protected works (and not sui generis protected works), a   database owner will still be able to enforce their database right even if the   copyright-protected elements of the database have been licensed under a Creative   Commons license. The two exceptions are the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/">Creative Commons Netherlands</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/be">Creative Commons   Belgium</a> licenses, which include the database right in the license   and, thus, these licenses will enable people to appropriate and distribute   database contents to the public.</p>
      <h2><a name="authority" id="authority"></a>How does a database provider make sure it has the   necessary authority to apply a Creative Commons license to a   database?</h2>
      <p> Creative Commons licenses can be applied to a   copyright-protected work by either the original creator of that work or by a   person who has the express permission from the original creator (the licensor of   the work).</p>
      <p> In the case of a database and its many different elements,   database providers need to think about how they obtained each element because   this will assist in identifying whether they have the necessary rights and   permissions. Essentially, the database elements can only be made available under   a Creative Commons license: (1) if the database provider is the owner of the   copyright in those elements; or (2), where the database providers does not own   the copyright but it has the express and explicit permission (a license) from   the owner of copyright to do this.</p>
      <p> The original creator of a work will   generally be the first owner of copyright in that work. A person can also become   the copyright owner by an express written agreement, signed by a creator or   copyright owner, transferring ownership of the copyright. In some circumstances,   an employer becomes the first owner of copyright in anything created by their   employees. In the US, there is an additional category of works in respect of   which ownership of copyright will be transferred from the creator to another   party&mdash;works made for hire. To qualify as a work for hire, the work must come   within one of nine categories of works, be specially commissioned and be the   subject of a written and signed agreement that the work is a work for hire. For   more information about works for hire under United States law, check out this <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ9.html">information circular from the   United States Copyright Office</a>.</p>
      <p> Before database providers   make a database or database elements available under a Creative Commons license   they need to make sure they own the rights or have the necessary licenses. This   process is known as &quot;rights clearance.&quot;</p>
      <p> Often databases are generated by   a network of individuals contributing and editing data. Many contributors often   do this without any legal agreements in place.&nbsp; If contributed data are   sufficiently creative for copyright to apply, then each contributor likely owns   the copyright to his or her submission.&nbsp; To offer these data under a Creative   Commons license, each contributor must agree to do so.&nbsp; If, however, the   contributions are factual, then rights need to be cleared only if the law that   applies to the database protects such information. Database providers can   include a condition in the &quot;Terms of Submission&quot; (or something similar) that   expressly provides that any person who submits information agrees to make their   submission available under a Creative Commons license and any other terms set   out in the &quot;Terms of Use&quot; or other legal notices section.</p>
      <p><a name="notcovered" id="notcovered"></a>What legal issues do   Creative Commons licenses not cover?</p>
      <p> Creative Commons licenses   only apply to copyrightable works. There may be many other legal issues that   arise in relation to copyrighted materials that Creative Commons licenses do not   cover and that database providers need to consider. For example, Creative   Commons licenses do not affect patent rights. Although copyright does not   protect factual information, patent law does protect ideas, inventions,   processes and methods. Database owners should think about the extent to which   they need to make their database users aware of the fact that patent rights may   restrict the use that can be made of the factual information contained in a   database.</p>
      <h2><a name="implement" id="implement"></a>I   understand everything above and want to apply a Creative Commons license to my   database. How do I go about doing that?</h2>
      <p> Visit <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">our &quot;Publish&quot;   page</a> to select the license that suits your preferences via our   license generator. Remember that before applying a Creative Commons license,   database providers need to make sure that they own the necessary rights, or have   the necessary permissions from the people who do own the rights, to make the   database available under a Creative Commons license. Also, database providers   should remember to think about exactly which components of their database they   want to be used and reused in accordance with a Creative Commons license and   make sure that this is clearly marked on the database.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2><a name="user" id="user"></a>I am a   database user, does this mean I can just use &amp; copy anything from a Creative   Commons-licensed database?</h2>
      <h2><a name="whichparts" id="whichparts"></a>Which parts can I use under   the Creative Commons license?</h2>
      <p> Under a Creative Commons license a   database user can use all of those parts of a database that the database owner   makes available under the Creative Commons license&mdash;consistent with the terms of   that license. Because databases are complex, database users should carefully   check which elements are under the Creative Commons license and which are not.   They should also carefully the terms of the applicable Creative Commons license   to under what uses are permitted and which are not. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/meet-the-licenses">This page provides   an overview</a> of the Creative Commons licenses.</p>
      <h2><a name="factsarefree" id="factsarefree"></a>Facts are (generally) free   (as in freedom)</h2>
      <p> In general, &quot;facts are free&quot; so database users   should be able to use factual information contained in a database without   restriction. Database users should, however, check any &quot;Terms of Use&quot; or other   legal notices that the database provider has applied to the database in case   additional conditions have been placed on the use of the factual data contained   in the database.</p>
      <h2><a name="beaware" id="beaware"></a>Be   aware that Creative Commons licenses do not license all types of legal   rights</h2>
      <p> Database users should be aware, before they freely use the   facts or database elements, of some possible limitations imposed by different   types of laws that may restrict the extent of data that can be used and that are   not licensed by the Creative Commons licenses. Examples of potential limitations   that may be imposed are by: (1) patent law; and, (2) for databases hosted in the   European Union, laws that recognize a database right (which we explain some more   below); (3) laws in jurisdictions in which copying a large amount of data is   considered to be the equivalent of copying the database itself (which we also   explain some more below).</p>
      <p>To find out more information about whether   something is protected by a patent (and you are based in the United States), you   should check out the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">United States Patent &amp; Trademark   Office</a>. It also has <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/main/profiles/international.htm">links to non-United   States based patent bodies</a> and international patent organizations   that may also provide you with useful information to understand the scope of   patent rights.</p>
      <h2><a name="dbrights" id="dbrights"></a>Consider that database rights may   apply</h2>
      <p> Users of European databases should also be aware of the fact   that the database may be protected by a sui generis (ie. copyright-like)   database right that is not actually a copyright right and thus, not licensed   under the standard Creative Commons licenses (except the Belgium &amp;   Netherlands Creative Commons licenses).</p>
      <p>The database right applies to   databases that have been created with considerable investment and protects   against unauthorized extraction and re-utilization of the data. In general, it   is an infringement of this database right to appropriate and distribute to the   public the whole or part of the contents of the database without the database   owner's permission.</p>
      <p>With two exceptions, a Creative Commons license will   not impact the existence of this database right and thus, database users need to   check out the &quot;Terms of Use&quot; or other legal notices section to see if the   database owner is limiting its database right in any way. The Creative Commons   Netherlands and the Creative Commons Belgium licenses include the database right   in the license and thus, these licenses will enable you to copy and distribute   database contents consistent with the license terms.</p>
      <p>Of course, none of   the Creative Commons licenses or database terms will limit the four exceptions   to the database right. The four exceptions are for use: (1) for private purposes   of a non-electronic database; (2) where there is use for the sole purpose of   illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is   indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be   achieved; (3) where there is use for the purposes of public security of for the   purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure; (4) where other exceptions   to copyright (such as fair use or fair dealing) are involved, without prejudice   to points (1), (2) and (3).</p>
      <h2><a name="think" id="think"></a>Think before copying large amounts of data</h2>
      <p>In some jurisdictions, it may be an infringement   of the copyright in database overall, to copy and use large amounts of data,   even if it is unprotected factual information. Consequently, if a database user   is planning to copy large amounts data, whether factual or not, they may want to   think about whether their use is in keeping with the Creative Commons license   and/or if it is not, whether they may otherwise be infringing on the copyright   in the database overall (if that has not been licensed under a Creative Commons   license).</p>
