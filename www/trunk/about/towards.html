<p class="tagline">A brief history on why Creative Commons launched the
Science Commons project.</p>
<p>The sciences depend on access to and use of factual data. Powered by
developments in electronic storage and computational capability,
scientific inquiry is becoming more data-intensive in almost every
discipline. Whether the field is meteorology, genomics, medicine, or
high-energy physics, research depends on the availability of multiple
databases, from multiple public and private sources, and their openness
to easy recombination, search and processing. </p>
<h2>Traditions in Intellectual Property </h2>
<p>In the United States, this process has traditionally been supported
by a series of policies, laws, and practices that were largely
invisible even to those who worked in the sciences themselves. </p>
<p>First, American intellectual property law (and, until recently, the
law of most developed countries) did not allow for intellectual
property protection of "raw facts." One could patent the mousetrap, not
the data on the behavior of mice, or the tensile strength of steel. A
scientific article could be copyrighted. The data on which it rested
could not be. Commercial proprietary ownership was to be limited to a
stage close to the point where a finished product entered the
marketplace. The data upstream remained for all the world to use. </p>
<p>Second, US law mandated that even those federal government works
that could be copyrighted, fell immediately into the public domain - a
provision of great importance given massive governmental involvement in
scientific research. More broadly, the practice in federally funded
scientific research was to encourage the widespread dissemination of
data at or below cost in the belief that, like the interstate system,
this provision of a public good would yield incalculable economic
benefits. </p>
<p>Third, in the sciences themselves, and particularly in the
universities, a strong sociological tradition - sometimes called the
Mertonian tradition of open science - discouraged the proprietary
exploitation of data (as opposed to inventions derived from data) and
required as a condition of publication the availability of the datasets
on which the work was based. </p>
<h2>Innovation in Technology and Legal Friction </h2>
<p>Each of these three central tenets evolved from concepts that
existed even before the Industrial Revolution--at the innately slow
rate of change of the legal system. Similarly, scientific publication
has a long-standing tradition. Modern technologies, especially the
evolving use of the World Wide Web as a library, have forever changed
the mechanisms for delivery and replication of documents. In many
fields, results are published nearly as quickly as they are found. But
copyright law has evolved at a different rate. Progress in modern
technology combined with a legal system designed for a different
technology-based environment is now leading to some unintended
consequences. One of these is a kind of legal "friction" that hinders
reuse of scientific discoveries and could lead to discouraging
innovation. </p>
<p>To counterbalance, a large and vibrant community has joined together
in support of the concept of Open Access for scientific literature - "<a
 href="http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/overview.htm">digital,
online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing
restrictions</a>". The U.S. National Institutes of Health have <a
 href="http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-04-064.html">proposed
mandated Open Access to all NIH-funded research</a> starting six months
after the print date, and there is support for the initiative in the
U.S. Congress. Most major journals have granted authors the right to
self-publish versions of their peer-reviewed papers. But the legal
questions - how can an author make her work available to the public,
while taking comfort that she retains some rights to it - have yet to
be answered. </p>
<p>The different rates of change between modern technology and the law
create friction in other places as well. For example, in the genetic
realm, patent law has moved perilously close to being an intellectual
property right over raw facts - the C's, G's A's and T's of a
particular gene sequence. In other areas, complex contracts of adhesion
create de facto intellectual property rights over databases, complete
with "reach through agreements" and multiple limitations on use.
Legislatively, the US is considering and the EU has adopted a "database
right" which actually does accord intellectual property protection to
facts - changing one of the most fundamental premises of intellectual
property: that one could never own facts, or ideas, only the inventions
or expressions yielded by their intersection. </p>
<p>The Federal government's role is also changing. Under the important
and in many ways admirable <a
 href="http://www.cogr.edu/docs/Bayh_Dole.pdf">Bayh-Dole statute</a>,
federally funded researchers are encouraged to look for potential
commercial use of their research. Universities have become partners in
developing and reaping the fruits of research. This process has yielded
amazing results in many cases by converting raw, basic science into
useful products in many industries. But as a consequence, the quest to
commercialize has moved upstream in some cases, to the fundamental
levels of research and data, and that has created complex legal
requirements. While the details can get complex when the intellectual
property at hand is <a
 href="http://www.signalsmag.com/signalsmag.nsf/0/8F89A41E7971F90888256EA9006A99DE">a
novel "method"</a> for assaying biological activity, there are even
more questions about <a
 href="http://www.forbes.com/2004/02/17/cx_mh_0217pfe_print.html">patents
covering the genes, proteins and their inferred functions</a>. </p>
<p>The sheer cost in terms of time and money of such complex,
multi-party legal work can take intellectual property "out of play" -
it is simply more expensive to do the lawyer work than the product
might reap on the open markets after the legal work is done. This
hinders scientific innovation, as the value of scientific information
increases exponentially in connection with other scientific
information, and is of the least possible value when segregated by law.
</p>
<h2>The Search for a Solution </h2>
<p>These facts have not gone unnoticed. Numerous scientists have
pointed out the irony that, at the historical moment when we have the
technologies to permit worldwide availability and distributed
processing of scientific data, legal restrictions on transfer make it
harder to connect the dots. Learned societies including the National
Academies of Sciences, federal granting agencies such as the National
Science Foundation, and other groups have all expressed concern about
the trends that are developing. Any solution will&nbsp; need to be as
complex as the problem it seeks to solve, which is to say it will be
interdisciplinary, multinational, and involve both public and private
initiatives. </p>
<h2>Enter Science Commons </h2>
<p>Science Commons is an exploratory project to apply the philosophies
and activities of <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative
Commons</a> in the realm of science. Science Commons works in three
project areas: <a href="../projects/publishing/index.html">Publishing</a>,
<a href="../projects/licensing/index.html">Licensing</a>, and <a
 href="../projects/data/index.html">Data</a>.</p>

<p>"&#8212;but there are also huge amounts of data that do not need to be
kept behind walls. And few organizations seem to be aware that by
making their data available under a Creative Commons license&#8230;they can
stipulate both rights and credits for the reuse of data, while allowing
its uninterrupted access by machines."</p>
