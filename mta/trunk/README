The scicom.mta_web project includes the code and static files for the
Science Commons MTA web application.  This package requires Python 2.4 or later.

Installation
============

scicom.mta_web and its dependencies may be installed using `easy_install 
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_ (recommended) ::

  $ easy_install scicom.mta_web

Installing scicom.mta_web using easy_install will create an ``mta`` script in
your Python bin directory.

Development & Deployment
========================

This project uses `zc.buildout <http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_ to 
manage dependencies and deployment.   After checking out the code, run 
``bootstrap.py`` to download zc.buildout and its dependencies ::

  $ python bootstrap/bootstrap.py

After running bootstrap, you can run buildout to install the project for
development in the local directory ::

  $ ./bin/buildout

This will retrieve the run-time dependencies of the project and place them
in the ``eggs`` directory.  It will also create a development egg for the
MTA-specific code.  A development egg is a special link file in the 
``develop-eggs`` directory which links the code in development to the local
Python environment.

You can then run the test server by running the ``mta`` wrapper script which
buildout generates ::

  $ ./bin/server

The server runs on port 8082.
