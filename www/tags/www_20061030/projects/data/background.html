      <p class="tagline">The NeuroCommons is a proving ground for the   ideas behind Science Commons' Data Project. It is built on the legal   opportunities created by Open Access to the scientific literature and the   technical capabilities of the Semantic Web.      </p>
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>The Neurocommons project, a collaboration between Science Commons and the   Teranode Corporation, is building on <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/">Open Access</a> scientific   knowledge to build a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> for neurological   research. The project has three distinct goals.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To demonstrate that scientific impact is directly related to the freedom to   legally reuse and technically transform scientific information - that Open   Access is an essential foundation for innovation. </li>
        <li>To establish a framework that increases the impact of investment in   neurological research in a public and clearly measurable manner. </li>
        <li>To develop an open community of neuroscientists, funders of neurological   research, technologists, physicians, and patients to extend the Neurocommons   work in an open, collaborative, distributed manner. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Today's life scientist faces a dizzying array of knowledge sources. Peer   reviewed journal articles, online repositories of sequences and pathways,   robot-driven data collection, and more must be integrated into experimental   design and analysis. Many scientists spend as much time on Google and PubMed as   they do at the bench; the difference between success and failure in the lab or   clinic can be the judicious and timely utilization of information. But this is   all local knowledge utilization. The logarithmic explosion of information in   science overwhelms any one individual's ability to store and model all the   relevant science in her head.</p>
      <p>The result is a &quot;scalability problem&quot; in life sciences: while methods for   generating information have gone digital, methods for using that information   remain stolidly analog. Technology can help. Bandwidth, processing and storage   are cheap. Machines can transmute from a string such as &quot;aaattcaggagattacaggta&quot;   to a physical molecule of DNA &ndash; and back again, making genetic information truly   fungible, something that can be shared via the Web. Advances in language   processing and ontology development allow for the construction of   machine-readable and interpretable representations of scientific information.   Logic and reasoning engines can crawl across massive data sets and come back   with suggestions on causation. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately it is neither cheap nor easy to seize the moment and apply the   technological advances to the human problem. Legal and economic factors have to   date muted the impact of new technologies on the life sciences: copyrights and   contracts intertwine with software-enforced restrictions on reusing and   republishing knowledge in a more usable format. But there is enough information   on the Web, in the form of taxpayer-funded databases and openly licensed   scientific literature, to demonstrate the utility of a legally open, technically   standardized approach to knowledge. And, in so doing, to sow the seeds of a   massive change in how scientific knowledge is licensed and reused.</p>
      <h2>The technological opportunity: Semantic Web</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic   Web</a> (SW) is at root a set of common standards to describe and name   the relationships we contemplate and describe in text: this gene is active in   this disease, is related to this protein. Using the standard allows us to   republish this kind of knowledge into a format that software can exploit: search   engines, browsers, statistical analysis. </p>
      <p>The life sciences represent an ideal test case for the Semantic Web. SW   technologies make the most sense where there is a certain set of conditions. </p>
      <ul class="paragraphic">
        <li>A massive amount of data: clinical images, robot-arrayed &quot;gene chips&quot;,   machines that can sort materials cell-by-cell, gene sequencers and massively   high throughput chemical screens. There are hundreds of public databases, from   flies to humans to plants, each potentially able to inform a decision or   experimental design. </li>
        <li>Rapidly changing knowledge: every journal article, every paper, every   experiment in the lab creates new knowledge about our bodies and the world we   live in. This makes it very hard to apply traditional computational approaches   or even integrate the data. We know what goes into a car &ndash; engine, tires,   wheels, axles, fenders &ndash; and thus we can create a fairly fixed representation of   a car for a computer, for model building and more. But we don't have anything   resembling consensus to items as fundamental as &quot;what is the role of the   non-coding DNA in the human genome?&quot; </li>
        <li>Distributed knowledge and expertise: the nature of modern life science is   specialization. One scientist is an expert on the genetics of Huntington's   Disease (a rare neurodegenerative disease) another an expert on the impact of   protein folding on Alzheimer's Disease. The two both work on the brain, on many   of the same genes and proteins. But they attend different conferences and are   pressed for time to study the refereed literature outside their own disease.   Possible synchronicities between the researchers are at a minimum because their   knowledge can't interoperate without distracting them from the lab. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For this set of problems, SW is a natural fit. Like the Web, SW is intended   to scale through decentralization and an emphasis on information reuse. It is a   means to capture and network the relationships implicit in high volume data   sets, or the outputs of sophisticated analytic software. It can relate anything   to anything, as long as that anything has a unique name &ndash; so those data-driven   relationships can attach to the descriptions of their related genes and   proteins, and the knowledge about those genes and proteins as described in the   scientific literature. SW does not require that the picture be complete, either   &ndash; if the relationships between one gene and another change as our knowledge   changes, the technical burden is no lower than adding another hyperlink between   web pages. And the concept of integration around unique names makes it easy to   create serendipity between researchers: instead of bumping into a colleague in   the hall at the right time, a scientist can see the ecosystem of knowledge   around a gene expressing in the brain, whether that knowledge comes from her   work on Alzheimer's or a distant colleague's work on Huntington's. It all gets   published to the Semantic Web.</p>
      <h2>The legal and economic problem</h2>
      <p>So why then do we not already have a vast Semantic Web for life sciences?   Despite what appears to be an information overload, it is the sparseness of   machine-readable scientific knowledge to assist in interpretation restraining   the utility of the SW approach. There are technology limitations to extracting   this information, lack of consensus around what names to use, and the inherent   limitations of natural language processing prominent among them. </p>
      <p>These problems are being solved. The National Institutes of Health has   invested in the national centers for biomedical ontologies, language processing   technologies evolve in leaps and bounds, and public databases are investing in <a href="http://www.isb-sib.ch/~ejain/rdf/">machine   readability</a> and <a href="http://www.pir.uniprot.org/terms/">open licensing</a>. </p>
      <p>But there is a distinct lack of public &ndash; free &ndash; machine readable knowledge.   Scientific authors transfer their copyrights to journals, motivated by the   prospect of citation in a well known journal, the next grant, or tenure review.   Copyright extends for 75 years after the death of the author and can serve as   the foundation for contractual restrictions on access to knowledge. Knowledge   publishers' business models are moving from the sale of physical copies of   journals to renting access to digital copies. Digital rights management systems   enforcing those contracts prevent librarians from running advanced software   across the online versions of journal articles, preventing advanced analysis of   both the underlying knowledge and usage patterns of scientists. The laws and   technologies guarding such knowledge intertwine to create a set of barriers to   open access and reuse. </p>
      <h2>A path forward: The Neurocommons Project</h2>
      <p>The Neurocommons Project is a joint effort by Science Commons and the   Teranode Corporation, aiming to demonstrate the power of Semantic Web approach   based on Open Access information. We have built an initial community of   neuroinformaticists, practicing neuroscientists, Semantic Web experts and   language experts to ensure our work is accurate and scientifically valid. The   first stage is underway: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using automated technologies, extract machine-readable representations of   neuroscience-related knowledge as contained in full-text Open Access literature,   free text such as the PubMed abstracts, and legally open databases </li>
        <li>assemble those representations into a Semantic Web for neuroscience </li>
        <li>publish the graph freely </li>
        <li>assemble a standard software implementation to store, update, and manage the   changes to the graph as knowledge evolves </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Plans for stage two of the project involve the deployment of additional   software infrastructure, the development of operational manuals so that   interested parties can &quot;port&quot; the entire Neurocommons approach into new   scientific domains without involving Science Commons, new publishing techniques   to automatically add knowledge to the Neurocommons graph, and active community   development.</p>
      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p>Teranode provides direct financial support to the Neurocommons project as   well as in-kind donations of software and services. Jonathan Rees, formerly in   charge of the curated protein-protein interactions database at Millenium   Pharmaceuticals and a veteran of MIT's project MAC, leads the project on a day   to day basis as a Science Commons Fellow. The project is deeply involved with   the World Wide Web Consortium's Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group as   well as MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (which   hosts Science Commons).</p>
